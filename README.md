# Teachable Text Machine

This is a project inspired by (and code borrowed from) [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). The goal of this project was to provide a proof-of-concept for browser-based human-centered machine learning on text-based datasets.

Sentiment examples (positive, negative, and neutral) were taken from [tweeteval](https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval) as a sample training dataset.
